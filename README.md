# Shopping_Website_Using_MERN_Stack

The project aims to build an online shopping website ( clothing and accessories ) using MERN stack using technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB-database, React, NodeJS and Redux.

The website will have a Home page, Login and SignUp page, cart page and a particular product page for every product present with product description and colors available option, etc. 

## Steps To Run The Project Build

To get started you can simply clone the zip file of our project and install the dependencies. Install the dependencies with this command:

- npm install
- Download NodeJS and install
- npm create-react-app my-app (for creating react app)
- MongoDB cloud database- You can add a new database by changing the existing one or use the same database.
- To finally run the complete application, use command: npm run dev

We have used express js to create the server and we have designed the database model in model’s folder. All the data is mentioned in the data folder. Db.js is used to connect the database with the server.

All the data is stored in Mongo db as a collection. And it’s upto the user to add more functionality and creating a new collection to store in our backend database server.
